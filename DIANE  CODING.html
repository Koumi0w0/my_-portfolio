            The death of Capitan Tiago and Basilio's imprisonment were soon reported in the province, and to the honor of the simple <br>
            inhabitants of San Diego, let it be recorded that the latter was the incident more regretted and almost the only one discussed.<br>
            As was to be expected, the report took on different forms, sad and startling details were given, what could not be understood<br>
            was explained, the gaps being filled by conjectures, which soon passed for accomplished facts, and the phantoms thus created<br>
            terrified their own creators.<br></p>

            In the town of Tiani it was reported that at least, at the very least, the young man was going to be deported and would very<br>
            probably be murdered on the journey. The timorous and pessimistic were not satisfied with this but even talked about executions<br>
            and courts-martial-January was a fatal month; in January the Cavite affair had occurred, and they1even though curates, had been<br>
            garroted, so a poor Basilio without protectors or friends-<br></p>

            "I told him so!" sighed the Justice of the Peace, as if he had at some time advised Basilio. "I told him so."<br>
            "It was to be expected," commented Sister Penchang. "He would go into the church, and when he saw that the holy water was<br>
            somewhat dirty, he wouldn't cross himself with it. He talked about germs and disease, abá, it's the chastisement of God! He<br>
            deserved it, and he got it! As though the holy water could transmit diseases! Quite the contrary, abá!"</p>
